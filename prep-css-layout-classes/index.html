        <h3>Raiders of the Lost Ark</h3>
        <p>Lucas Conceived Raiders of the Lost Ark in the early 1970s. Seeking
        to modernize the serial films of the early 20th-century, he developed
        the idea further with Kaufman, who suggested the Ark as the film's goal. Lucas eventually
        focused on developing his 1977 space opera Stars Wars.</p>

        <h3> Temple of Doom</h3>
        <p>The film was released to financial success but initial reviews were
        mixed, criticizing its darker elements and violence. However, critical
        opinion has improved since 1984, criting the film's intensity and
        imagination.</p>

        <h3>The last Crusade</h3>
        <p>After the mixed reaction to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,
         Spielberg chose to tone down the dark tone and graphic violence in the
         next installment. During the five years between The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade, he and executive producer Lucas reviewed several
         scripts before accepting Jeffrey's Boam's.</p>
